A Pet Shop is providing service to its customers either having dog or cat as pets. Pet information is important for the 
Pet  Shop  so  that  records  can  be  collected  and  kept  for  future  use.  Pet  information  for  every  customer  varies
depending on the preference of the customer. The following are the possibilities upon recording the pet information:

  1)Pet name and type (Dog or Cat)
  2)Pet name, type (Dog or Cat), and breed
  3)Pet name, type (Dog or Cat), breed, and color
  4)Pet name, type (Dog or Cat), breed, color, and age
  5)Pet name, type (Dog or Cat), breed, color, age and sex
  6)Pet name, type (Dog or Cat), breed, color, age, sex and ownerâ€™s name
  
This is a  menu-driven  program  in  OOP  approach  usingJava to  simulate  the  recording  and  displaying (using  a 
howDetails () method of the Pet Class) the Pet Information for every transaction. Note that Pet objects should be 
created  using  OVERLOADED  CONSTRUCTORS  that  satisfies  the  fields  entered  by  the  user  depending  on  his/  her
choice among the given possibilities. The program will always show the menu for encoding information and should 
only stop when the user tries to select an EXIT Menu.

Test  the  program  in  a  separate  class  named  Main.java  that  will  contain  a main  method  to  execute  the  program. 
Make 6different objects of the Pet Class using the 6 different constructorsand print the details of each petby calling 
the ShowDetails () method of each petobjectafter each encoding process.
